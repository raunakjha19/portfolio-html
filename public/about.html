<p>
  Hello! I’m <b>Raunak Kumar Jha</b>, a dedicated and passionate Computer Science
  student at KIIT University in Bhubaneswar, Odisha. I’m currently pursuing my
  Bachelor’s degree (September 2021 - June 2025) with a CGPA of 8.19.
</p>
<p>
  My journey in the tech world started with a strong foundation in C
  Programming, Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs), Data Structures and
  Algorithms (DSA), and Database Management Systems (DBMS). I have hands-on
  experience with DBMS tools like Oracle and MySQL.
</p>
<p> I have a keen interest in
  Python and have used it for data analysis and machine learning. I have also
  built projects using various Python libraries. Currently, I’m delving into
  Full Stack Web Development, building scalable web applications, managing
  databases, and implementing APIs.
</p>
<p> My technical skills include programming
  languages such as C++, Java, Python, and C. I’m also proficient in JavaScript
  and have experience with tools and platforms like VScode and Eclipse. I have
  worked with MongoDB in the database domain.
</p>
<p> I have contributed to open-source
  projects and developed significant projects of my own. One of my notable
  projects is a deep learning system for brain tumor classification using
  Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). I trained the model on MRI scans across
  four classes and achieved high accuracy, demonstrating the model’s potential
  to support medical decision-making.
</p>
<p> Another project I’m proud of is the
  development of a Sign Language Alphabet Recognition (SLAR) system. This
  project aimed to facilitate communication between deaf individuals and the
  hearing community. I created an intuitive UI and implemented pyttsx3 for
  text-to-speech conversion. 
</p>
  <p>I hold certifications from Juniper Networks
  (JNCIA-Junos), HackerRank (Problem Solving Basic and Intermediate), and AWS
  Academy (Introduction to Cloud Semester 1).
